    "\n",
    "This notebook implements Monte Carlo simulations to estimate **fixation times** in evolutionary\n",
    "game dynamics on **multilayer (multiplex) networks**. We study the death-birth Moran process\n",
    "where strategies spread through a population based on fitness derived from game-theoretic payoffs.\n",

    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixation Time (τ)**: The expected number of generations until the population reaches\n",
    "  an absorbing state (all individuals adopt the same strategy)\n",
    "- **Death-Birth (dB) Update**: A randomly selected individual dies and is replaced by an\n",
    "  offspring from a neighbor, chosen proportionally to fitness\n",
    "- **Multilayer Network**: Two coupled network layers where dynamics on each layer can\n",
    "  influence the overall fitness of individuals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a 2-layer multiplex network:\n",

    "1. **Layer 1 (Game Layer)**: Individuals play a **Donation Game**\n",
    "   - Cooperators (C) pay cost c=1 to provide benefit b to neighbors\n",
    "   - Defectors (D) pay no cost and provide no benefit\n",
    "   - Payoff: $u_i^{(1)} = -x_i + b \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in N_i} w_{ij} x_j}{k_i}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Layer 2 (Constant Selection Layer)**: Individuals have type M or R\n",
    "   - Type M (mutant): fitness contribution = r\n",
    "   - Type R (resident): fitness contribution = 1\n",
    "   - Payoff: $u_i^{(2)} = x_i(r-1) + 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combined Fitness**: $F_i = 1 + \\delta(u_i^{(1)} + u_i^{(2)})$\n",
    "   - δ: selection intensity (δ → 0 is weak selection)\n",

    "### Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precomputation**: Neighbor lists and degrees are precomputed before simulation loops to minimize overhead.\n",
    "- **Parallelization**: Uses Python's multiprocessing with 'fork' context for efficient shared memory.\n",
    "- **Memory**: Each worker maintains independent state; total memory scales linearly with n_jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graphs must be connected; isolated nodes may cause infinite loops.\n",
    "- The 'fork' context may not work on Windows (use 'spawn' with appropriate modifications).\n",
    "- Very large networks (N > 10,000) may require optimized implementations.\n",
